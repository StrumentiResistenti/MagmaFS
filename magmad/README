                Distributed HashTable filesystem for Linux

	Magma is a network filesystem for Linux kernels. It's based on
FUSE userspace filesystem library. The goal is to provide a transparent
way to share files on more than one network server to provide scalability
and redundancy.

	Magma is based on well known client/server approach. magmad is
a network server which performs three kind of tasks:

	1. provide connection to mount.magma FUSE client (see below)
to allow remote mounting of directory trees;

	2. (will) provide interconnection with other Magma servers to share
and syncronize files across the net.

	3. (will) provide management console using simple telnet connection.

	Complementary software mount.magma is the FUSE Magma client which
uses FUSE user space library and allows mounting of remote filesystems.

	Magma is based on a simple binary protocol to provide smallest
bandwidth consumption. Protocol is defined in PROTOCOL file which should be
available in this software distribution.
